# BearHug---Frontend
Welcome to BearHug! This app was created with endangered species in mind. This application allows a user to see a list of
endangered species, read up on that species, and make a donation to the cause. As a user, you can track your donations and total amount donated.

This app was created as a way to help myself learn Vanilla JS. There may be flaws and hiccups throughout.

*This application does not take in personal credit information, nor is any money actually donated. This is simply for show.
*This ReadMe will cover both the front and backend setup.
